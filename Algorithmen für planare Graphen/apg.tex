% activate={true,nocompatibility} - activate protrusion and expansion
% final - enable microtype; use "draft" to disable
% tracking=true, kerning=true, spacing=true - activate these techniques
% factor=1100 - add 10% to the protrusion amount (default is 1000)
% stretch=10, shrink=10 - reduce stretchability/shrinkability (default is 20/20)
